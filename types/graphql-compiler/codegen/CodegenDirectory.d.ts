/**
 * CodegenDirectory is a helper class for scripts that generate code into one
 * output directory. The purpose is to make it easy to only write files that
 * have changed and delete files that are no longer generated.
 * It gives statistics about added/removed/updated/unchanged in the end.
 * The class also has an option to "validate" which means that no file
 * operations are performed and only the statistics are created for what would
 * have happened. If there's anything but "unchanged", someone probably forgot
 * to run the codegen script.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   const dir = new CodegenDirectory('/some/path/generated');
 *   // write files in case content changed (less watchman/mtime changes)
 *   dir.writeFile('OneFile.js', contents);
 *   dir.writeFile('OtherFile.js', contents);
 *
 *   // delete files that are not generated
 *   dir.deleteExtraFiles();
 *
 *   // arrays of file names to print or whatever
 *   dir.changes.created
 *   dir.changes.updated
 *   dir.changes.deleted
 *   dir.changes.unchanged
